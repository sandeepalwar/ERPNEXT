( commands are in blue letters ) 



Note: You need NOT upgrade Ubuntu from 20+ to 22+ for upgrading ERPNext to Version 14. EPRNext and Frappe 14 works both on Ubuntu 20+ and 22+ )



1- Take backup. ( Should I explain that !!! ) 



2- Make sure you don't have any customization those are not committed.

cd /opt/bench/frappe-bench/apps/erpnext

git status

Refresh index: 100% (6953/6953), done.

On branch version-13

Your branch is up to date with 'upstream/version-13'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean



/opt/bench/frappe-bench/apps/frappe

git status

On branch version-13

Your branch is up to date with 'upstream/version-13'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean



3-Check python version

python3 -V 

Python 3.8.10 ( needs to be upgraded to 3.10 )



4-check node version.

node --version

v12.22.12 ( needs to be upgraded to v16.X )



5-Check pip or pip3 version

pip3 --version 

20.2 ( needs to be upgrade to 22.x )





6- Upgrade python

sudo apt install software-properties-common -y

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa

sudo apt install python3.10 python3.10-dev python3.10-distutils



Confirm python version upgrade by

python3.10 --version

Python 3.10.6



Make Python 3.10 the default.

sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.10 1



Make sure python command executes python3

sudo apt install python-is-python3



python -V

Python 3.10.6



python3 -V

Python 3.10.6





7 - Upgrade PIP

 

curl -sS https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python3.10

pip install html5lib

pip3 install --upgrade pip

sudo apt-get remove python3-apt -y

sudo apt-get install python3-apt -y



check PIP verison and confirm.

pip --version

pip 22.2.2 from /home/erpnext/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pip (python 3.10)

pip3 --version

pip 22.2.2 from /home/erpnext/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pip (python 3.10)



8- Upgrade Node

curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | bash -

apt-get install nodejs redis-server -y



check node version and confirm

node --version

v16.17.0



9- Upgrade NPM

npm upgrade

sudo npm install 16

sudo npm install -g npm@8.19.1



check npm version and confirm

npm --version

8.19.1





10 -Move your old python env folder to env-archive, in-case anything goes wrong, you can return to the original



cd /opt/bench/frappe-bench/

mv env env-archive

----



11- Create new virtual env for python-3.10

pip install virtualenv

virtualenv --python python3.10 env

env/bin/pip install -U pip



12- Change git upstream from V13 to V14



env/bin/pip install -e apps/frappe -e apps/erpnext

pip3 install frappe-bench 

bench switch-to-branch frappe erpnext version-14 ( edited this line. Please see the note 2 ** ) 

( If the above command don't work, use this one )  bench switch-to-branch version-14 frappe erpnext --upgrade 



check upstream and make sure upstream repository is V14

cd /opt/bench/frappe-bench/apps/erpnext

git status

Your branch is up to date with 'upstream/version-14'.



cd /opt/bench/frappe-bench/apps/frappe

git status

Your branch is up to date with 'upstream/version-14'.



13- Install and upgrade V14. Please note that monolith is broken on V14 and you must install payments and hrms module in addition to ERPNext



bench get-app payments

bench get-app hrms

bench update --reset

bench --site *sitename* install-app hrms

bench --site *sitename* install-app payments

bench --site v13.erpgulf.com migrate



sudo service supervisor restart

sudo service nginx restart



That is it. Check whether you ERPNext and Frappe upgrade to V14





-------------

Note 1: *

If you face problem with nginx because of log type error ( log type main not found or something like that ) 

vvim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf and add following on http section.



log_format main '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" ' '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" ' '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';

Note:2 **



Note from ( https://discuss.erpnext.com/u/flexy2ky ) 

modify this command in your document:

bench switch-to-branch version-14

As this command will fail if the site has custom apps installed because the command will try to switch the apps to version-14 as well. so the command should be:

bench switch-to-branch frappe erpnext version-14

This ensures that the switch-to-branch command only affects frappe and erpnext and ignores any other installed app.
